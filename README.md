## Project Overview

This end-to-end machine learning project focuses on predicting student academic performance based on various socio-economic, demographic, and academic factors. The project implements a complete machine learning pipeline including data ingestion, exploration, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about student performance with features such as:
- Demographic information (gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education)
- Socio-economic indicators
- Academic preparation (test preparation course completion)
- Performance scores in different subjects (math, reading, writing)

## Model Information

This project evaluates several machine learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor

The models are compared using metrics such as R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like GridSearchCV.

## Results

The model evaluation results are as follows:
- Best performing model: 
- R-squared score: 
- RMSE: 

## Future Work

- Implement feature engineering to improve model performance
- Add more sophisticated algorithms like Neural Networks
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Add monitoring and model retraining functionality
- Implement A/B testing for different model versions
- Create a more interactive dashboard for visualizing predictions
- Extend the model to predict performance in additional subject areas
